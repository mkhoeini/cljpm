#+title: cljpm

Clojure Project Management

* Vision

** Subcommand Extensibility

Extensible with any global command.

#+begin_src shell
cljpm <arbitrary command>
#+end_src

I can include ~arbitrary.clj~ in right places and it will be called.

** Project File

The ~project.clj~ file is mostly compatible with leiningen. However, the idea
is that it is only supposed to provide information to other tasks, much like
~package.json~ of /npm/, and not to define tasks and etc.

** Standard Subcommands

- ~new~ It is like ~lein new~ to create a new project.
- ~init~ It is like ~npm init~ to create a default standard ~project.clj~.
- ~install~ To download dependencies and create a ~.lock~ file.

** Remarks

- It must be easy to define different repositories for packages, like /maven/, /npm/, /github/, etc.
- Dependencies must be cached in a global place, but installed to project for easy access.
- Easy way for passing configs like /rake/ envs.
- Standard /environment/ treatment for =dev/test/prod/...= for customizing dependencies, config, etc.
